                                            Lung Cancer Screening Models
This project presents a machine learning-based approach to identifying high-risk patients for lung cancer screening. By employing classification models, this project aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection efforts, potentially lowering mortality rates by flagging individuals who may benefit from further diagnostic testing.

                                            Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to classify individuals as high or low risk for lung cancer using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The study incorporates data preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation of multiple models to determine the most effective screening tool. The analysis includes handling missing data, normalizing features, and utilizing binary encoding to ensure model accuracy and reliability.

                                                Features
Data Preprocessing: Prepares the dataset by cleaning, standardizing, and encoding categorical variables to ensure optimal input for the models.
Model Selection: Implements a range of classification models, including:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Chosen for its effectiveness in identifying patterns in medium-sized datasets.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Evaluates linear separability of features.
Naive Bayes (NB): Provides baseline performance.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Utilizes complex pattern recognition for classification.
Performance Metrics: Focuses on recall and AUC-ROC to prioritize accurate identification of high-risk patients while balancing false positives.


                                               Results
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model achieved the highest recall (86%) and precision (85%), effectively identifying high-risk patients and minimizing unnecessary diagnostics. The model’s AUC-ROC of 73% demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing high-risk individuals, supporting its utility as a screening tool.

                                                Conclusion
This project supports early lung cancer detection by utilizing machine learning to stratify patient risk. The KNN model’s high recall rate is ideal for healthcare settings where identifying potential lung cancer cases is critical, while its precision helps minimize unwarranted testing. This model offers a promising approach to assist healthcare providers in making informed screening decisions.
